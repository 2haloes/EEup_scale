# EEup_scale

# WORK IN PROGRESS

This is currently an early WIP project, aiming to do basic image upscaling before updating the repo

This is written in Rust and uses egui

## Motivation

I've been intrested in AI upscaling for awhile and while I love tools such as [Cupscale](https://github.com/n00mkrad/cupscale), they are Windows only

To start, I want to create a project that take an image, set of images or a video and upscale them using a model and build up form there

# Working with

When cloning this project, use `git clone --recursive https://github.com/2haloes/EEup_scale.git` otherwise you won't get the submodules and things won't work
